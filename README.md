# ELO-beggers

This is a project to replace PLeague, the league app for our companies Fu√üball league. It is time for a proper v2, so here it is: the ELO-beggers app.

This project contains both the frontend as the backend. The latter is written in java and based on the [SparkJAVA](http://sparkjava.com/) framework. To run the fontend (in an IDE like Eclipse) just start as java-application. This will start a development server running on port 4567, to check open [http://localhost:4567](http://localhost:4567) the frontend is compiled in the `src/main/resources/public`-directory. The server depends on a running MongoDB server on the standard port.

The frontend has it's own development server which can be installed by changing into the frontend directory:

```
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

This will start a server running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) wich will proxy to the API backend.

The frontend is based on [Semantic UI](http://semantic-ui.com/) and the project template used is implemented in Angular2 using the excellent demo [angular2-semantic-ui](https://github.com/lon-yang/angular2-semantic-ui).

Until the gradle scripts are capable of compiling the frontend into the proper place you need to run the build step to generate the distribution bundle into the java-server's public directory:

```
cd frontend
npm build
git add .
git commit -am "New frontend or whatever, you get the point"
git push
```
